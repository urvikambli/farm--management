This Farm Management System is a comprehensive solution developed in PHP, designed to simplify and enhance the management of agricultural activities.
The system provides a user-friendly interface and is primarily targeted towards farmers.

User Authentication:

The system employs a secure login mechanism, allowing users to log in as either a farmer or a buyer.
Farmers, upon logging in, gain access to a suite of tools to manage their products effectively. The system enables farmers to handle inventory, facilitating seamless tracking and organization of agricultural produce.

The project is built using PHP, a server-side scripting language, and leverages the web development technologies for the user interface.
It requires a virtual server, such as XAMPP, to run successfully on a local machine.
For storing in databases, SQL is used.
